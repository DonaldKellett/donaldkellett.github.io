									<h2>About me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I am Donald Sebastian Leung, a Year 11 Student at Kellett.  My favorite subject is <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/math/projects">Maths</a>, and my favorite pastime is <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/code_blog">coding</a>.
								</p>
								<p> I have completed Maths IGCSE and Chinese GCSE last year with A*s in both subjects.  I am going to take the rest of my I/GCSEs this year, possibly along with Further Pure Maths IGCSE. </p>
								<h3>Recent Events</h3>
								<ul>
								<li>My Further Maths Mock Exam turned out to be 100%.  However, I still do not know my scores for my other subjects.  Hopefully I will get good grades for my other subjects as well! :)</li>
								<li>I have created a website for our company in the JA Company Programme: <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/innovision">Innovision</a></li>
							</ul>
								<!-- <p>
									I graduated from Kumon Mathematics a year ago when I was in Form 2.  I have also completed Level X in Kumon Mathematics (12/07/14).
								</p>
								<p>
									I have also taken the Mathematics IGCSE (Higher Tier) at the end of Year 10.
								</p>
								<p>
									I completed an <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/epymt_blog/tdg">EPYMT</a> programme (held by CUHK) with a satisfactory score.

								<!-- <h3>About Kumon</h3>
								<p>Kumon is a tutorial centre founded by Toru Kumon.  It is well-known for its Kumon learning method, which differs from other tutorial centres.  Kumon (HK) offers courses in English, Chinese and Maths.  English is further split into EFL (English as a Foreign Language) and ERP (English Reading Programme).</p>
								<h3>Kumon Mathematics</h3>
								<p>The levels of difficulty in Kumon Mathematics are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p>Level 7A-A: Level 7A-A is mainly about counting and recognizing numbers, as well as some simple addition.  It is equivalent to K1 to Grade 1.</p></li>
									<li><p>Level B-F: Level B-F is mainly about the four operations.  For example, level B comprises of addition (and possibly some subtraction).  Level C is mainly about multiplication, Level D is mainly about division and so on.  It is equivalent to the primary school years.</p></li>
									<li><p>Level G-I: Level G-I comprises mainly of mathematics equivalent to Form 1 to Form 3 level.  Here, students learn about basic algebra, Pythagoras Theorem and so on.  They are also asked to recognise simple graphs such as linear and quadratic ones.</p></li>
									<li><p><b>Level J-O: These are referred to "the Senior Levels" in Kumon.  At these levels, mathematics becomes much more serious.  Students learn about formulas such as the Quadratic Formula (Level J) and the Addition and Subtraction Formulas (Level M).  Calculus is introduced in Level L and gets progressively harder as the student progresses through the remaining levels in Kumon (Levels M, N and O).  At the end of Level O, students are asked to take an exam in the Headquarters of Kumon.  The exam lasts for exactly one hour and includes content from Level J straight to Level O.  After that, they are considered a Kumon Graduate.</b></p></li>
									<li><i><p>Level X: Level X is an elective level.  After the student completes Level O and becomes a Kumon Graduate, they can choose to continue by studying Level X.  Level X is split into five topics: XM (Matrices), XT (Trigonometry), XV (Vectors), XS (Statistics) and XP (Probability).  The total number of worksheets in Level X is 420, which is over twice the number of worksheets in a regular level.</p>

									<p>The distribution of worksheets for each level are as follows:

									<ul>
									<li>XT: 30 worksheets</li>
									<li>XM: 90 worksheets</li>
									<li>XV: 140 worksheets</li>
									<li>XP: 90 worksheets</li>
									<li>XS: 70 worksheets</li>
									</ul></p>

									<p>The topics in Level X are totally new to students, and so do not require prior knowledge from the "core" levels (Level 7A-O).  However, they must be comfortable with working with advanced algebra.  Exceptions to this are Level XT and Level XS.  In Level XT, the students have to be familiar with advanced trigonometry as well as advanced algebra.  In Level XS (Worksheets 21-30), the students have to be familiar to some basic rules of integration.</p>
									</i></li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Benefits of Kumon Mathematics</h3>

								<p>The Kumon Method (Mathematics) is considered rigorous by most students because they have to complete a worksheet every day (including holidays).  Moreover, calculators are not allowed in Kumon even in the Senior Levels.  However, this has a number of benefits:</p>

								<ol>
								<li>The students develop a good learning habit over time (provided they can adapt to the rigorous course in the first place).</li>
								<li>By banning calculators, students develop an ability to calculate quickly and accurately.</li>
								</ol>

								<p>In Kumon Mathematics, students are usually asked to start at a level way below their current level.  Some students and parents think that this is a waste of time and money.  However, this is not true.  Kumon does this to check for any weaknesses in their foundation.  Otherwise, students may experience difficulties in the higher levels.</p>

								<p>Another important benefit of Kumon Mathematics is that the students are only asked to complete worksheets that match their level (regardless of their age and other students' progresses).  A six-year old child may be finishing the final levels of Kumon Mathematics, while a secondary school student may be asked to complete worksheets on multiplication.  This ensures that students who are weak at Mathematics can catch up effectively and that students who are able in Mathematics do not get "dragged behind" in their progress.</p>

								<p>Note that most of the points mentioned above are also true for the other subjects in Kumon.</p>

									<!-- <li>During June 11 to June 13 (2014), I went to a Year 9 Mathematics Competition in Harrow as an overaged student.  Nobody outside of Kellett School found out that I was Year 10.  Our team did not win, but we learned a lot in the trip.</li> -->
									<!-- <li>Recently, I have been offered admission to a Mathematics Summer Course in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  The summer course is called <a href="http://epymt.math.cuhk.edu.hk/course/TDG2014.html">Towards Differential Geometry</a>.</li> -->
									<!-- <li> After approximately one and a half years, I have finally completed all the topics in Level X.  Hooray! </li> -->
									<!-- <li> I am now trying to (unofficially) complete every single A-level module in Mathematics with an A/A* (preferably an A*) so that I can start Further Mathematics (A-level) at the start of next school year (with the help of <b>Mr. Dwyer</b>). </li> -->
									<!-- <li> I have completed the <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/epymt_blog/tdg">TDG</a> course in EPYMT with a satisfactory score. </li>
									<li> I hope to (unofficially) start Further Mathematics (A-level) in the coming school year with the help of Mr. Dwyer.  For the Statistics and Mechanics Units, I have decided to leave them until I officially start A-level mathematics. </li> -->

								<h3>To principal of Kellett School - other projects on coding</h3>
								<b>Dear Principal and other members of staff who may be viewing this website,</b>
								<p>I am Donald Leung from Year 10 Youde, and I have taken part in the ECA <i>Web and App Development</i>.  My coding teacher is Nickey Khem, and he has asked me to present this website to you.</p>
								<p>According to what Nickey Khem said, the ICT department in Kellett School is still at a preliminary stage and has lots of potential for expanding.  I am here to promote the expansion of the ICT department and the ECA activities related to computer technology in Kellett School.</p>
								<p>The reason I want to promote the expansion of the ICT department is because over the six two-hour lessons on coding, I have learned a lot of coding skills.  Besides that, I have learned a lot about computers and websites themselves.  Coding is not as hard as it looks at first glance.  I have learned two programming languages, HTML and CSS within the course of three lessons, and I am now more than halfway through the course of Javascript.  All that is required to learn code is a focused mind and a determined heart.</p>
								<p>To show you what code can do, I have included the following links to other projects that I have recently made:</p>
								<p><a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/ironman_jump">Iron Man Jump (this was actually created by my teacher)</a></p>
								<p><a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/ironman_jump_deceptive">Iron Man Jump (Deceptive Mode)</a> - I made some interesting changes to Nickey's game - try it out!</p>
								<p><a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/code_blog">My Blog on Coding</a> - this contains all my other versions of Iron Man Jump.  Check it out!</p>

									<h2>FAQ</h2>
								</header>

								<ol>
									<!-- <li><p>Do you consider Kumon Mathematics hard?</p>
										<p>Yes I do actually, especially the Senior levels.  You have to remember a lot of formulae by heart and calculate complicated fractions without a calculator.</p></li>
										<li>
											<p>Do you consider Kumon Mathematics boring?</p>
											<p>Well, I do sometimes, because it is quite repetitive and hard.  However, it is also great fun solving Maths questions that most people in your year cannot solve.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
										<p>Which topic in Level X do you find the hardest?</p>
										<p>I find the Statistics Module (XS) hard, because it requires a lot of prior knowledge from Probability (XP) and the numbers are just horrendous.  The thing I find slightly irritating is that I am not allowed to use a calculator, no matter how complicated the arithmetic gets.</p>
										</li>
										<li><p>Why do you like Kumon so much?</p>
											<p>I like Kumon a lot because I started studying Kumon Maths from a very young age (4-5 years old).  It also gives me an edge over other students in Maths class, and I am very proud of it.</p></li>
											<li>
											<p>Why did you choose to complete the Level X Worksheets?</p>
											<p>I thought it would be fun (and useful) if I broadened and deepened my understanding in Mathematics.  Also, the idea of doing "university maths" way ahead of my classmates made me really excited (although the maths in the elective topics are just equivalent to the first year in University and some are just equivalent to Form 5 or Form 6).</p>
