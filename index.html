									<h2>About me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I am Donald Sebastian Leung, a Year 10 Student at Kellett.  My favorite subject is currently Maths, and my favorite pastime is <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/code_blog">coding</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									I graduated from Kumon Mathematics a year ago when I was in Form 2.  I am currently doing the extra worksheets (Level X) provided by Kumon.  Of the five elective topics provided by Kumon, I have (inofficially) completed Level XM and Level XT.  I am currently working on level XV.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have also taken the Mathematics IGCSE (Higher Tier) at the end of Year 10.
								</p>
								<h3>About Kumon</h3>
								<p>Kumon is a tutorial centre founded by Toru Kumon.  It is well-known for its Kumon learning method, which differs from other tutorial centres.  Kumon (HK) offers courses in English, Chinese and Maths.  English is further split into EFL (English as a Foreign Language) and ERP (English Reading Programme).</p>
								<h3>Kumon Mathematics</h3>
								<p>The levels of difficulty in Kumon Mathematics are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Level 7A-A: Level 7A-A is mainly about counting and recognizing numbers, as well as some simple addition.  It is equivalent to K1 to Grade 1.</li>
									<li>Level B-F: Level B-F is mainly about the four operations.  For example, level B comprises of addition (and possibly some subtraction).  Level C is mainly about multiplication, Level D is mainly about division and so on.  It is equivalent to the primary school years.</li>
									<li>Level G-I: Level G-I comprises mainly of mathematics equivalent to Form 1 to Form 3 level.  Here, students learn about basic algebra, Pythagoras Theorem and so on.  They are also asked to recognise simple graphs such as linear and quadratic ones.</li>
									<li><b>Level J-O: These are referred to "the Senior Levels" in Kumon.  At these levels, mathematics becomes much more serious.  Students learn about formulas such as the Quadratic Formula (Level J) and the Addition and Subtraction Formulas (Level M).  Calculus is introduced in Level L and gets progressively harder as the student progresses through the remaining levels in Kumon (Levels M, N and O).  At the end of Level O, students are asked to take an exam in the Headquarters of Kumon.  The exam lasts for exactly one hour and includes content from Level J straight to Level O.  After that, they are considered a Kumon Graduate.</b></li>
									<li><i>Level X: Level X is an elective level.  After the students completes Level O and becomes a Kumon Graduate, they can choose to continue by studying Level X.  Level X is split into five topics: XM (Matrices), XT (Trigonometry), XV (Vectors), XS (Statistics) and XP (Probability).  The total number of worksheets in Level X is 400, which is twice the number of worksheets in a regular level.</i></li>

									<!-- <li>Today is Father's Day!  Happy <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io/fathers_day_temporary">Father's Day</a>!</li> -->
									<li>During June 11 to June 13 (2014), I went to a Year 9 Mathematics Competition in Harrow as an overaged student.  Nobody outside of Kellett School found out that I was Year 10.  Our team did not win, but we learned a lot in the trip.</li>
									<li>Recently, I have been offered admission to a Mathematics Summer Course in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  The summer course is called <a href="http://epymt.math.cuhk.edu.hk/course/TDG2014.html">Towards Differential Geometry</a>.</li>
