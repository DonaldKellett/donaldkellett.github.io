Donald Leung's Website
======================
Welcome to my website!  This website contains everything about me and my projects (mainly math and coding projects).  I will use this website for, at the very least, the next two to three years, and will probably use it for many years to come.
# Main Pages
The main pages in my website are as follows:
 - Home
 - Math
 - Notifications
 - Qualifications
 - Code
 - Further Maths IGCSE Library
All pages are openly available to any visitor who visits my website.  Further Maths IGCSE Library was once a private page and required a secret code, but is now open to everyone.  The code to accessing it is 'visitor'.
# Widgets
This website contains a number of interesting features/widgets:
 - Tawk.to chat widget
 - Timer (runs up to 24 hours)
The chat widget (powered by http://tawk.to [Tawk]) means that when I am online, you can chat with me freely.  As for the timer, I coded it myself and it shows how long you have been on my website.  Don't worry - no data is sent back to the server or any third party.
# Baseline [Skel] Version
This website uses the 2.0.1 version of Baseline (provided by Skel), which is a bit outdated, but nonetheless awesome with its simple and comfortable design, along with a flexible grid system.  I am too lazy to update my Baseline version to a newer version, because there is already too much content on the website and it will take way too long for me to redesign the whole website.
To see the Baseline/Skel license, please go to the files LICENSE.txt and README.txt
# Languages
In case you are new to coding, this website is created using three main languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
```html
<h2>I'm Baseline</h2>

}
