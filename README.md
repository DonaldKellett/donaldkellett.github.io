Donald Leung's Website
======================
Welcome to my website!  This website contains everything about me and my projects (mainly math and coding projects).  I will use this website for, at the very least, the next two to three years, and will probably use it for many years to come.

# Main Pages
The main pages in my website are as follows:

 - Home
 - Math
 - Notifications
 - Qualifications
 - Code

All pages are openly available to any visitor who visits my website.  Please note that as of 21/05/15, *Further Maths IGCSE Library* has been deleted.

# Widgets
This website contains a number of interesting features/widgets:

 - Tawk.to chat widget
 - Redirect Timer on [404 Page](http://donaldkellett.github.io/404.html)

The chat widget (powered by [Tawk](http://tawk.to)) means that when I am online, you can chat with me freely.  As for the timer, I coded it myself and it shows how long you have been on my website.  Don't worry - no data is sent back to the server or any third party.

# Baseline [Skel] Version
This website currently uses the newest version of Baseline - v3.0.0-dev by [n33](http://n33.co).  It was recently redesigned (21/05/15).

# Languages
In case you are new to coding, this website is created using three main languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
```html
