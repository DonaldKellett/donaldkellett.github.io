# Donald Leung's Website

Welcome to my website!  This website contains everything about me and my projects (mainly math and coding projects).  I will use this website for, at the very least, the next two to three years, and will probably use it for many years to come.

## Main Pages
The main pages in my website are as follows:

 - Home
 - Math
 - Qualifications
 - Code

... plus a Settings page.

Further Maths IGCSE Library was deleted in the most recent website redesign that occurred in late May, while the Notifications Page was combined with the "Recent Events" section in the homepage.

## Interesting Features
This website contains a number of interesting features:

 - Tawk.to chat widget
 - Redirect Timer on [404 Page](http://donaldkellett.github.io/404.html)
 - Email Form
 - Search Form

The chat widget (powered by [Tawk](http://tawk.to)) means that when I am online, you can chat with me freely.  As for the timer, I coded it myself and it shows how long you have been on my website.  Don't worry - no data is sent back to the server or any third party.

I have also recently added an email form that can be filled in before the email is sent, and a search form that makes use of Google Search (default) or DuckDuckGo (optional) to perform in-site searches.

## Baseline ([Skel](http://skel.io)) Version
This website currently uses the newest version of Baseline - v3.0.0-dev by [n33](http://n33.co).  It was recently redesigned (21/05/15).

## Languages
In case you are new to coding, this website is created using three main languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
```html
<h2>I'm Baseline</h2>

}
